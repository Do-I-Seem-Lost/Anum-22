# Anum-22

This has turned into an annual practice project for me.
I will fill in the details as I suss them out.

It seems that there are a million mobile apps out there. Who is keeping track?

I started out with a simple counting game, then it morphed.

I am having a little difficulty describing the mechanics of it. It's not as if it could possibly be completely different from anything else.
I am not greatly experienced in working with mobile apps.
The right coding is definitely the hard part, but I will get it up.
